## These program are assignments fo rmy Lab Course ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ

You can also find pre-compiled binaries from releases.

To run them, simply download them, copy to another folder (if needed) and open the terminal.

``cd`` into the location (if not already done) and just type the executable name to run (example: -> ``.\3.exe``)

Feel free to contribute if you feel so.

<i>Thanks</i>   c( ¯ ਊ ¯ )つ
